What is a Linked List ?
A Data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.
Linked List consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.

Comparison with Arrays:
List:
(_) Do not have indexes!
(_) Connnected via nodes with a next pointer.
(\*) Random access is not allowed.

Arrays:
(_) Indexed in order!
(_) Insertion and deletion can be expensive. (Insertion and deletion re-arranges the indexes. This is the reason why we mainly use linked lists)
(\*) Can quickly be accessed at a specific index.
