Hash Table or Hash Map :

Hash tables are used to store key-value pairs.
They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered.
Unlike arrays, hash tables are fast for all of the following operations: finding values, adding new values, and removing values!

Build-In Hash tables in programming lang:
Python has Dictionaries
JS has Objects and Maps (Objects have some restrictions, but are basivally hash tables)
Java,Go & Scala has Maps
Ruby has Hashes

What makes a good hash?
(_) Fast (i.e constant time)
(_) Doesn't cluster outputs at specific indices, but distributes uniformly.
(\*) Deterministic (same input yields same output)
