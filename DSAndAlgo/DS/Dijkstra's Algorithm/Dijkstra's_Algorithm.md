Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm is used to find the shortest route.
We will use in weighted Graph to find the shortest path from one vertex to another.

Edsger Dijkstra invented Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.

Why is it useful:
(_) GPS - Finding fastest route
(_) Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data.
(_) Biology - used to model the spread of the viruses among humans
(_) Airline tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination
(\*) Many other uses!
